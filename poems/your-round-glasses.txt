The rim surrounds your eyes,
forming concentric orbit bronze,
with planets of lovers young.

With gaze the embracing copper shines,
accentuating your eyes like a lofty crown,
like morning stars that glorify rising Sun.

O! How, in those round glasses,
could you ask me not to try,
when oft your glances do stop by?
