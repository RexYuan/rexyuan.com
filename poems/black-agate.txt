On the midnight train I ponder
our relationship.
Against the seat I recline
away from time.

On the midnight bike I ride
with the joy of you and the sorrow of you.
Under the warmth of city lights,
you are the bliss of mine and the curse of mine.

Your bracelet, black agate,
is my heart forlorn.
Your smile, sunshine,
is my eternal night.
