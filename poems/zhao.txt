I walked upon deserts,
crossing over seas,
without knowing when,
or even if I will find you.

You didn't exist yesterday,
nor the day before.
Yet you shall reside in my heart,
until the end of days.

For all the thunders on the ridge
and the ripples on the lake
are colorless when I see you,
the pigeons fleet.
