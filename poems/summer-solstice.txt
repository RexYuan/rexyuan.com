Summer ends when September ends.
Summer ends when September ends.
                Our story ends when September ends.

Summer ends when September ends.
When youâ€™ll sing our songs again?
Lover does but the uncomplained.
Who shall I dream in prance?

Summer ends when September ends.
When the moon has come to ebb?
Lover goes hind the wane.
How could I have a chance?

Summer ends when September ends.
        Summer ends when our story ends.

Summer ends when September ends.
The bowl rings empty, the cry of tramp.
Lover begged in vain.
Where was the fall of dance?

Summer ends when September ends.
The adamant are poorest of men.
Lover prayed in vain.
Were we both in trance?

    Our story ends when our story ends.
Lover weeps of mercy, of promise of France.
Summer ends when September ends.
I yet yearn a glance.
