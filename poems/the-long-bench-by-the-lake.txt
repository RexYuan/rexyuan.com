title:      The Long Bench By The Lake

I like the long bench by the lake,
as I like any other benches we have sat.

The lake we command is lush,
rife with the elegance of embracing mountains,
and over the precipice,
resounds a flamboyant jubilance.

Closer and stronger we push against each other,
so there is no space between us.

Your hair, a little messy,
but just right, with those slightly curly ends.
Your skin, a little tanned,
but just right, with the smoothly spotty curves.

Your voice, orientally accented,
is my mind enchanted.
Your character, opulently sophisticated,
is my heart delighted.

I taste the oyster
of a thousand worlds in you.
I see the kaleidoscope
of a million wonders in you.

We frolic,
on the lakeside bench
under the summer sun,
drenched,
in the refined affection
of your extravagant richness.

I like the long bench by the lake,
as I like any other benches we have sat.
