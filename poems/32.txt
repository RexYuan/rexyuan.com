Without cumbrance, only remembrance,
we walk onwards, freely into the future,
turning over the shoulders on a step,
taking one last look before moving on.

What am I standing here for,
if not for the pavilion in the alpine mist,
or the pearl white beach over the field of reeds?

It's the slices of ordinary joy,
like seeing your head poking out the cubicle,
or taking the long walk across the paths amiss.

On the rooftop, under Taipei sky,
I feel something brewing,
over there, beyond the sunset horizon,
waiting to begin.


    Remember our promises.
    Remember us, Kayla.
