She walks on the blue beach,
untainted, and so is the sea.
Fingernails of the broken wave
touch tips with her untanned feet.

The girl sits and breathes.


All the screams held within
the ocean deep,
blocked by the flimsy screen
of a marine keep.

The stronghold of dream
and the kraken underneath
were buried
and unseen.

She rests her palm and grips,
spilling out a castle
as the mirage sands slip
from her determined fist.


When the ebb leaves,
the infested lair will unleash
ten thousand hallow shivs.

Trembling air, shivering pores,
brought the wetness that sets in,
exposing the remnants of sealed evil,
oozing fire,
concocted and complete.

Horns of angels,
halos of griffins,
and spears of gorgons,
unavenged, rise as
carbon trickles from
cracks of weathered
vanity.


She who walks on the beach
shall dive in.
