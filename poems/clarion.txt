Smelting silver, smithing steel,
crucible of a dwindling ember
roaring, unceases.

She wields the celestial light,
bound and sworn by creed,
exalted by plated armor, studded.

An atomic tome of ancient cream,
winnowing the ruffled chasms,
howling an untold grit.

Imbued by auric rays of mornings,
her turquoise hair, under a beam,
exudes seraphic power.

The angelic force endowed,
heavenly pyrrhic,
conjured her fate of deity.
