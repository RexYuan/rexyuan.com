\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica}{Taipei, Taiwan}{Research Assistant}{May 2023 - Present}
\item Published an AI fairness auditing framework and open-source tool supporting 15 statistical metrics, which systematically confirmed racial bias in the COMPAS dataset as reported by ProPublica in 2016. The paper appeared in 2024 PNC as ``Ensuring Fairness with Transparent Auditing of Quantitative Bias in AI Systems''.
\item Proposed a privacy-preserving AI fairness auditing framework using differentially private synthetic data, evaluated across 5 machine learning models and 3 real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent bias detection while mitigating privacy risks. The paper is in the review process.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{SiFive}{Hsinchu, Taiwan}{Hardware Engineer}{Sep 2022 - Apr 2023}
\item Acted as the code owner of the assertion-based verification monitors of a bus communication protocol in Chisel/Scala, improving verification coverage by approximately 12\% in the company's flagship product. This contribution strengthened the hardware verification process, a critical step in preventing costly design bugs.
\item Developed regression automation tools for FPGA system validation in Bash and Perl, streamlining the validation process and reducing overnight continuous integration time by about 18\%. This improvement was key in ensuring on-time project delivery during a high-pressure final sprint.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica}{Taipei, Taiwan}{Research Assistant}{Jan 2017 - Jun 2022}
\item Developed a hardware model checking algorithm based on Boolean learning and interpolation solving about 400 out of 747 instances in HWMCC10 benchmark. For comparison, the decade-old, state-of-the-art Berkeley tool solves about 600 instances on the same hardware.
\item Designed a scalable SAT-based solution for Message Sequence Chart synthesis by reducing the NP-complete Poset Cover Problem, efficiently handling inputs with up to 100 linearizations and 10 elements.
\item Proved the NP-hardness of k-anonymity Checking Problem and developed a randomized algorithm thereof for the 2010 Taiwanese Population And Housing Census data that revealed a minimum quasi-identifier of size 35 that identifies 37.7\% of the database.

\begin{rSection}{Activities}

\begin{rSubsection}{Computer and Information Club}{Taipei, Taiwan}{Vice President}{Sep 2017 - Jun 2018}
\item Worked closely with 5 other club staff members to co-organize joint workshops with the Electronics Club on Arduino programming, attended by approximately 30 students.
\item Delivered hands-on courses on chatbot programming using Facebook and Line API to a group of 10 students.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{CourseNTNU}{Taipei, Taiwan}{Creator}{Dec 2014 - Dec 2015}
\item Developed a crawler of school course registration system by reverse-engineering the API calls.
\item Built a course rating website using PHP and jQuery that attracted approximately 2,000 users and generated around     168,700 pageviews. Collaborated with 3 additional contributors who joined following the project's initial success.
